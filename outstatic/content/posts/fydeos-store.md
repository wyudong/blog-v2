FydeOS App Store offers thousands of carefully curated web apps, browser extensions, themes, and Android applications. Initially, it featured only a handful of system apps. After I took over, I continuously expanded its resources and optimized the product, transforming it into a fully featured app store.

Responsibilities:

- **Data Crawler:** Independently developed a crawler system to fetch resources from the Chrome Web Store, significantly expanding the app library.
- **Front-End and Back-End Development:** Fully responsible for developing the FydeOS App Store’s front-end built with React and Material-UI and back-end (initially Node.js + MongoDB), later refactored to Golang + Postgres for enhanced performance and stability.
- **Management Dashboard:** Designed and implemented a management dashboard to facilitate bulk app uploads and updates, streamlining operations and improving data management efficiency.
- **Automated Android Installation:** Leveraged the FydeOS Android subsystem to develop automated installation scripts, enabling users to download and install Android apps directly from the store— improving system compatibility and overall user experience.
