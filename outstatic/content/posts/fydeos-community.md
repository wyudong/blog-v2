Discourse is an open-source forum software built with the Ember.js and Ruby on Rails tech stack.

Responsibilities:

- **Version Upgrades:** Regularly upgraded Discourse to the latest version, resolving code conflicts and bugs encountered during the update process.
- **Network Optimization:** Addressed domestic network issues by optimizing the update process, thereby reducing failures and downtime caused by network interruptions.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Developed a language-switch plugin for quick toggling between Chinese and English in the navigation bar.
- **Subscription Management:** Customized a subscription plugin allowing users to enter activation codes in the forum to obtain higher-level permissions.
- **Ticket System:** Built a ticket system plugin enabling users to submit support tickets directly in the forum, ensuring faster response times.
